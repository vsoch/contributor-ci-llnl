This repository will contain [Contributor CI](https://github.com/vsoch/contributor-ci) results for LLNL, meaning data extracted from
repos and members defined in  [contributor-ci.yaml](contributor-ci.yaml) that are generated and then pushed back to the repository.
In addition to these data files, eventually there will be contributor friendliness assessments
and visualizations to go along with the data. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/contributor-ci-llnl/issues)
if you have a question or point of discussion.
